## Functionalities

With this app, using a simple graphic user interface, you can:
- Add books to a personal library
- Provide personal data about those books (Is book read ? Start date / End date)
- View your library, sort your books in it
- Edit a specific field in a already added book (right-click on the field in the library display)
- Generate a Annual Review animated page

***Screenshots below !***

More to come :
- Show stats monthly, yearly or by custom period
- Export your book library and/or your personnal record library
- Use a multi-user login, with separate libraries
- An extended Annual Review page
- Translation to french

## Development

I build this app for a friend who wanted something simple to store the books she read and get a annual reading review.
I made it in two layers:
1. Data storage/management core implementation
2. A Tkinter GUI interface

This project is not perfect but it has been a great help in applying and developing my coding skills.  
I'm currently working on a more ambitious version : [Project Kallaxy](https://github.com/VincNT21/project_kallaxy) 

## Setup Instructions 
This project uses a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/VincNT21/books_shelf_and_stats.git
